Personal exploration of multiplayer game, using DatagramPacket library to send game information to multiple users.

## How to Run
Server.java runs the server side of the server side of the game and will only display when a player connects or disconnects in the console. (default port 55555) 

Main.java runs the client side of the game. Use the menu to join the server (defaulted to local host on port 55555). Arrow keys move the player and esc opens the menu to leave the server.
